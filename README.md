todo:
- make game list/synonyms, build regex off of that
    - parser dependent? parsers should be objects?
- characters/players should be case-insensitive/collapsable
- fgc css
- document how to run scala script
- support multiple characters (slash splitting)
- sort by date descending on all lists (might be free?)
- look into CapcomFighters/alternative channels
