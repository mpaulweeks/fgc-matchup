# todo.txt

## (re)design
- find a way to algorithmically fix typos/collapse similar players/chars
- support games with multiple chars
- support videos with multiple chars
- embed/inline video view (with cookie-based toggle setting)
- improve regex
    - better debugging misses
    - more centralized/shared logic between parsers

## research
- add more support for Olympic games/style
- look into iShoryuken https://www.youtube.com/user/iShoryukenTV
- look into CapcomFighters/alternative channels

## quickies
- add real url encoding/decoding for params
- add contact footer, link to github, remove FORK ME banner
- overhaul readme, describe how to contrib
- advertise this site on sfv.FGC
    - similar banners?
    - break out the www subdomain as a hub? would help clarify that only sfv is "shut down"
