# todo.txt

when in doubt: `git grep todo`

## (re)design
- find a way to algorithmically fix typos/collapse similar players/chars
- support games with multiple chars
- support videos with multiple chars
- embed/inline video view (with cookie-based toggle setting)
- improve regex
    - better debugging misses
    - more centralized/shared logic between parsers

## research
- research ways to minify `video.json` that still works with git
    - normalize data?
- look into CapcomFighters/alternative channels

## quickies
- add real url encoding/decoding for params
- overhaul readme, describe how to contrib
